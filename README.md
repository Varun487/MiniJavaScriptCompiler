# Mini Compiler for JavaScript

Implementing a ```mini compiler``` that takes as input a JavaScript program (with focus on the programming construct for loop statements) and produces an optimized intermediate code as an output.

# What is the project about?

This project uses ```yacc``` and ```lex``` to generate a mini compiler for JavaScript. A ```mini compiler``` performs lexical analysis, symbol table generation and syntax validation. This project intends to manage assignments, datatypes, evaluate expressions and emulate loops in javascript.

# To replicate this project on your computer
1. To initalize the project:
```
git clone git@github.com:Varun487/MiniJavaScriptCompiler.git

cd MiniJavaScriptCompiler

make

```
2. To compile and run a program:
```

./jscompiler < test.js

```
